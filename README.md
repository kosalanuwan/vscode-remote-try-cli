# Try out CLI (.NET)

Develop in .NET 5.0+, includes minimal required set up to get started. In case you were wondering, this `.devcontainer` is:

- Based on `dotnetcore` development container found in [@microsoft/vscode-dev-containers][devcontainers-repo]
- Ideal for [.NET 5.0+][dotnet-sdk-docker-image] with .NET Core, .NET Core CLI, and ASP.NET Core, and
- Includes with [Azure CLI][azure-cli-docs] and [Node][node-js-docs]

## Configuration Options

```bash
dotnet new console -n Weather.Cli -o src/Cli
dotnet add src/Cli package Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting  --prerelease
dotnet add src/Cli package System.CommandLine --prerelease
dotnet new sln -n Cli
dotnet sln add src/Cli
```

- [The VS Code Remote - Containers docs][vscode-remote-docs] is a good source to learn more about `.devcontainer.json` configuration options and its usage.
- [See .NET Core CLI page][dotnet-core-cli-docs] to learn the full-blown `dotnet` options.
